# Admin Security Setup Guide

## Overview

Your admin area (`/admin`, `/admin/login`, `/admin/editor`) is now protected by a **two-layer security system**:

1. **IP Whitelist** - Automatically grants access to whitelisted IP addresses
2. **Password Protection** - Required for non-whitelisted IPs

---

## How It Works

### When you visit `/admin`:

1. **System checks your IP address** against the whitelist
2. **If your IP is whitelisted** ‚Üí Access granted automatically ‚úÖ
3. **If your IP is NOT whitelisted** ‚Üí Password prompt appears üîí
4. **After successful password entry** ‚Üí Access granted ‚úÖ
5. **Session persists** until you close the browser

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Your Admin Password

You'll need to add your admin password as a secret environment variable:

1. In Replit, click the **Secrets** tool (lock icon) in the left sidebar
2. Add a new secret:
   - **Key**: `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - **Value**: Your secure password (e.g., `MySecurePass123!`)
3. Save the secret

**Password Requirements:**
- At least 12 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Keep it secret and secure!

### Step 2: Whitelist Your IP Addresses

Edit the file `public/admin-whitelist.csv` to add trusted IP addresses:

```csv
# IP Whitelist for Admin Access
# Add one IP address per line
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Format: IP_ADDRESS,DESCRIPTION

127.0.0.1,Localhost
::1,Localhost IPv6

# Add your IP addresses below:
123.456.789.012,Office IP
98.765.432.109,Home IP
45.67.89.101,VPN IP
```

**How to find your IP address:**
- Visit: https://www.whatismyip.com/
- Copy your IPv4 address
- Add it to the CSV file

**Multiple IPs:**
- Add one per line
- Include a description for reference
- Separate with a comma

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. Visit `/admin` on your website
2. **If your IP is whitelisted:**
   - You should see the admin dashboard immediately
3. **If your IP is NOT whitelisted:**
   - You'll see a password prompt
   - Enter your admin password
   - Access granted!

## File Locations

- **IP Whitelist**: `public/admin-whitelist.csv`
- **Security Code**: `src/utils/admin-security.tsx`
- **Protected Routes**: `/admin`, `/admin/login`, `/admin/editor`

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error:
- **Check your IP** against the whitelist
- **Try the password** if IP not whitelisted
- **Verify password secret** is set correctly

### Password Not Working:
- Check `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` secret is set
- Restart the workflow after changing password
- Password is case-sensitive

### IP Whitelist Not Working:
- Verify IP format is correct (IPv4: 123.456.789.012)
- Check for typos in CSV file
- Make sure line isn't commented out with `#`
- Clear your browser cache

### Can't Access from Mobile/Different Location:
- Add that location's IP to whitelist, OR
- Use the password to access from anywhere

## Production Deployment Notes

### For Replit Deployments:
- IP whitelist will work automatically
- Password protection is active
- Make sure `public/admin-whitelist.csv` is deployed

### Additional Security (Optional):
You can add additional security layers:
- 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- Tina Cloud authentication
- OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- VPN requirement
- Time-based access restrictions

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use a strong, unique password
- Whitelist only trusted IPs
- Review whitelist regularly
- Keep password secret secure
- Change password periodically

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Share your admin password
- Whitelist public/shared IPs
- Use simple passwords
- Commit passwords to Git
- Leave test IPs in production
