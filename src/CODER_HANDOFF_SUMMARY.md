## üéØ YOUR IMMEDIATE TASKS

### 1. Update SEO Settings (5 minutes)
**File:** `/components/SEOHead.tsx`

```javascript
// Line 33 - Replace with your domain
const SITE_URL = 'https://mortgagegenius.com';  // ‚Üê Change this!

// Line 19 - Add your preview image
ogImage = 'https://yourdomain.com/og-image.jpg'  // ‚Üê Change this!
```

**What you need:**
- Your production domain URL
- A 1200x630px preview image for social media

---

### 2. Create Contact Page (30 minutes)
**Why:** Footer form submits to `/contact` with query strings

**What to build:**
A contact page that reads these URL parameters:
- `?name=John`
- `&email=john@example.com`
- `&message=How can we help?`

**Example code:**
```javascript
// In your /contact page component
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const name = urlParams.get('name') || '';
const email = urlParams.get('email') || '';
const message = urlParams.get('message') || '';

// Pre-fill your contact form with these values
```

---

### 3. Test Accessibility (15 minutes)
**Keyboard Navigation:**
1. Press `Tab` key repeatedly
2. Verify you can reach all buttons, links, and forms
3. Check that focus indicators (green rings) are visible
4. First Tab should show "Skip to main content" link

**Screen Reader (Optional but Recommended):**
- MacOS: Press `Cmd + F5` to enable VoiceOver
- Windows: Download NVDA (free)
- Navigate the site - everything should be announced clearly

---

### 4. Update Placeholder Links (30 minutes)
**Files to update:**
- `/components/Header.tsx` - Navigation links
- `/components/Footer.tsx` - Footer links

**Find and replace:** Change `href="#"` to real URLs

**Example:**
```javascript
// Before
<a href="#">Apply Online</a>

// After
<a href="/apply">Apply Online</a>
```
