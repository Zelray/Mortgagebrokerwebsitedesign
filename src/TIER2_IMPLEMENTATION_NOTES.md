# TIER 2 IMPLEMENTATION - $50K WEBSITE
## Lead Capture, Analytics, and Legal Compliance

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. LEAD CAPTURE SYSTEM (`/supabase/functions/server/leads.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Professional lead management with CRM integration and database backup

**Why both Copper CRM AND Database?**
As you mentioned, you're sending everything to Copper - but here's why we still need the backup:
1. **Reliability:** If Copper webhook is down, leads are still captured
2. **Validation:** Prevents duplicate submissions within 24 hours
3. **Analytics:** Track conversion rates and lead sources
4. **Compliance:** Maintain audit trail for regulatory requirements
5. **Debugging:** If Copper doesn't receive a lead, you can see it in the database

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Validates and sanitizes all inputs
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate submissions (24-hour window)
- ‚úÖ Saves to Supabase database as backup
- ‚úÖ Sends to Copper CRM via webhook
- ‚úÖ Tracks form type and lead source
- ‚úÖ Error handling and detailed logging
- ‚úÖ Provides lead statistics endpoint

**How it works:**
```
User submits form
    ‚Üì
1. Validate inputs (name, email format)
2. Check for duplicates (last 24 hours)
3. Save to database (backup)
4. Send to Copper CRM (primary)
5. Return success to user
6. Track analytics event
```

**TODO for coder:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Update Copper webhook URL
   - File: `/supabase/functions/server/leads.tsx`
   - Line: 30
   - Replace `https://your-copper-webhook-url.com/webhook`
   - Get URL from: Copper CRM ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks

2. **Alternative:** Use n8n webhook instead
   - Create n8n workflow with webhook trigger
   - Add Copper CRM node to send data
   - Use n8n webhook URL in the code

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /leads` - Create new lead
- `GET /leads` - Get all leads (admin)
- `GET /leads/stats` - Get lead statistics
