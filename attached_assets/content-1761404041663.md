Home Equity Line credit card

## Home Equity Line of Credit

### For debt consolidation, home improvements or large expense.

A **home equity line of credit, or HELOC**, works like a credit card. You are able to borrow up to an approved amount over a certain period, commonly known as a draw period. During that time, you can withdraw money as you need it. As you pay down the principal balance, your credit revolves, and you can use it again, payments are based on amount advanced and not the full loan amount. HELOCs tend to be the most popular type of home equity loan.

Home equity lines of credit often have more flexible repayment terms than a standard home equity loan. Home equity loan payments are typically fixed over the repayment period, while home equity lines of credit can offer interest-only payment terms, or outstanding balances can be repaid using a variety of repayment strategies.
