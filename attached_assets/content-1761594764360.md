Strapi and Next.js both build on the same philosophy: open source is the path to success. Combine them with Vercel deployment and you have a stack with virtually infinite scalability, global performance, and security.\\

# Frequently  Asked  Questions

Looking for answers? Here are some common questions we've been asked.

What is an admin user?

A Strapi "admin user" is anyone who has the ability to login to your Strapi admin panel, this is not limited to the role of the user and these limits do not apply to non-production environments.

Developers in staging or development environments, automation accounts and "end-users" are not considered admin users.

Learn more about [Strapi Admin users](https://support.strapi.io/support/solutions/articles/67000665400-who-is-considered-an-admin-user).

Is there a minimum number of admin users for the different Enterprise Edition plans?

Yes, there is a minimum of 10 admin users in the self hosted Enterprise Edition. [Please contact our sales team](https://strapi.io/contact) to inquire about volume discount for large number of admin users or infrequent usage

Where can I find the Enterprise License Terms?

The terms and conditions for the CMS subscriptions are governed by the Enterprise License Terms, located [here](https://strapi.io/enterprise-terms).

Can I purchase a license monthly, quarterly, or for lifetime?

The Growth CMS plan is offered on a monthly subscription basis, paid monthly, while our Enterprise CMS plan is 12-month subscriptions, paid annually.

How are the paid CMS subscriptions delivered?

The paid CMS subscriptions are an extension of the Community plan. Therefore if you are upgrading your Community project there is no need to start from scratch because the upgrade process is seamless. Once you have completed your purchase, we will send you a dedicated license key and an installation guide to unlock the additional features in your plan.

How do I deploy my Strapi project ?

Strapi is self-hosted. It's up to you to decide where to deploy and host your Strapi project. We have a list of [deployment guides](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.html) for Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, Google App Engine and Heroku. You can also use our [1-click deploy buttons](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/digitalocean-one-click.html#digitalocean-one-click) and [Docker installation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/docker.html#step-1-create-a-docker-compose-yaml-file).

What's the definition of a project?

A Strapi "project" is defined as a single Strapi application that contains a single "model structure" and the same model logic; but can be deployed in such a way as to handle large amounts of traffic.

Please find more information [here](https://support.strapi.io/support/solutions/articles/67000645666-what-is-the-definition-of-a-project).

Who are the companies using Strapi in production?

Thousands of companies such as [Delivery Hero](https://strapi.io/user-stories/delivery-hero), [Societe Generale](https://strapi.io/user-stories/societe-generale-e-training-platform) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value) are using Strapi in production today. Check out [our showcase](https://strapi.io/showcase) to see more examples.

Who is behind Strapi?

Strapi is actively sponsored and maintained by Strapi, Inc the company behind the Strapi open-source project. Visit [the company page](https://strapi.io/about-us) to learn more about the company and the team.

How long does it take to learn how to use Strapi ?

It usually takes developers less than 5 minutes to get up and running with Strapi. It will then take a few hours to get familiar with the source code, admin panel, and more advanced concepts to customize or integrate Strapi with other tools. You're not alone though, Strapi has an engaged and welcoming community that writes tutorials and helps each other out.

What is the definition of a seat?

A "seat" refers to a registered user account on a specific Strapi instance and environment, occupied by one user at a time. Please see this [article](https://support.strapi.io/articles/1102131845-key-licensing-definitions-for-strapi-enterprise-edition) for more information.
