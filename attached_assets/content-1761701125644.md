## Home Loan Options

FCU’s mortgage team will help you find a mortgage option that best suits you with the term you need and the monthly payment you can afford.

### Fixed-Rate Mortgage³

A fixed interest rate means your principal and interest payment remain the same for the life of the mortgage. The most common terms are 30-year, 20-year or 15-year fixed rate mortgages.

[Learn More](https://flcu.org/loans/mortgages/fixed-rate-mortgage/)

### Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)⁴

ARMs feature rates that will adjust periodically based on market conditions; however, the initial rate is typically lower than a fixed option. It's a good option if you plan to sell or refinance your house before the rate goes up.

### FHA/USDA/VA - Backed Mortgages

Pre-approval

Before you start looking for a new home, discuss the features and benefits of the different programs you may be considering, then choose which is best for you.


![](https://flcu.org/FLCU/media/Images-Folder/numbers-02.png)

Communicate

Collaborate with your MLO and realtor to ensure the property type you’re interested in fits the specific program’s guidelines. Also discuss the impact of fees, taxes and insurance to the budget and pre-approval.


![](https://flcu.org/FLCU/media/Images-Folder/numbers-03.png)

Contract

Once you’ve found your new home and the contract is signed, there are items within the contract that need to be completed for closing, including placing your formal application, signing your preliminary disclosures and more.

Closing

Finally, you’ll finish the formal process of completing your contract. After you sign the loan documents, and the ownership is transferred, you’ll get the keys!

## Mortgage FAQs

Expand AllCollapse All

## How do I make a payment on my mortgage loan?

There are many convenient and safe options for you to make a payment on your FCU loan. View your available payment options [here](https://flcu.org/resources/solutions/make-a-payment/).


## How much can I afford?

A great rule of thumb to use is 2.5 times your annual household income. If your income is $75,000 annually then a good starting point is $187,500.

## What documents do I need?

FCU doesn’t require documents upfront from borrowers in order to issue a preapproval letter.  A completed mortgage application is needed in order for one of our loan officers to get you preapproved for a mortgage.

After you are preapproved, then the items on [this checklist(Opens in a new window)](https://flcu.org/getmedia/17bb9e7e-3c8d-47ec-98bf-45a0ab5dbfc7/Mortgage-Approval-Checklist.pdf) will be needed in order to proceed with the mortgage. These documents can be uploaded to our secured portal.

## What are mortgage points?

Mortgage points, also known as discount points, are fees a homebuyer pays directly to the lender in exchange for a reduced interest rate. One point is 1% of the mortgage loan amount. It’s important to consider how long you’ll own the home and the time it will take to recoup the cost of buying points. Let our MLO help you decide if paying points is a good option for you.


## Is an appraisal required?

An appraisal is needed on most loans. However, there are some FNMA (conventional) loans that may qualify for an appraisal waiver. This will be determined once we have an application with a known address.


## Do I find a house first or apply for the loan first?

Either way is fine. If you already have a home in mind feel free to apply. The quickest way to find a home however is to make sure to get pre-approved for the loan first. This will empower you, so that you know what price range to look for. Also, you will know beforehand your potential mortgage payments. A pre-approved letter shows the seller and the realtor that you are a qualified buyer. Realtors will be more inclined to show you homes, and even offer you first preference if there are multiple offers, especially if the other buyers aren’t pre-approved.


## What is escrow?

When you make your mortgage payment, a monthly portion of it goes towards your taxes and insurance, establishing an escrow account. Escrow accounts are beneficial in that you're able to pay taxes and insurance on a monthly basis instead of a large lump sum payment annually.

If you have any specific questions about your escrow account, please email [Escrowinsurance@flcu.org](mailto:Escrowinsurance@flcu.org).

## How can I submit a proof of insurance?

You can submit proof of insurance by emailing the document to [Escrowinsurance@flcu.org](mailto:Escrowinsurance@flcu.org).
